# Brain-Stroke-Prediction
ðŸ§  Brain Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning This project focuses on early detection of brain strokes using a Random Forest classifier trained on medical data. By identifying key patterns and risk factors, the model predicts the likelihood of a stroke, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.
